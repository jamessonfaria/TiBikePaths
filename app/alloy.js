// This is a great place to do any initialization for your app
// or create any global variables/functions that you'd like to
// make available throughout your app. You can easily make things
// accessible globally by attaching them to the `Alloy.Globals`
// object. For example:
//
// Alloy.Globals.someGlobalFunction = function(){};

// collection user defined as a global
Alloy.Collections.Users = Alloy.createCollection('user');

// collection without Alloy and Model, using the backbone
Alloy.Collections.BikePaths = new Backbone.Collection();
